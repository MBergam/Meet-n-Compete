                <p>As many people have experienced, finding people to organize pick up games with can be difficult. 
                    Often a person will head over to a local park just to find out that the park is already being used, 
                    there arenâ€™t enough people, or the people that are there are all different ages.</p>
                <p>This project will help bring a solution to these problems, allowing users to view events and locations via a map, 
                    while also being able to create events of their own for others to see and join.</p>
                <p>Meet-N-Compete will provide an online means to help people organize pick-up games and reduce the difficulties and confusion that usually accompany.</p>
